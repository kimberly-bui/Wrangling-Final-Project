# COVID-19 and Factors Relating to Healthcare Attrition 

## Kim Bui & Camille Eastvold  

Since 2019, the coronavirus has been infecting the world. Years later the U.S. is still dealing with the symptoms of high turnover and poor retention rates across the healthcare industry. Is the job market still in recovery?  

The COVID-19 pandemic has had profound and lasting effects on the healthcare sector, particularly in the United States. Healthcare institutions continue to grapple with issues such as high turnover, reduced job satisfaction, and an increased workload for remaining staff. Nurses, as a cornerstone of the healthcare workforce, have been disproportionately affected. 

This study analyzes trends in job satisfaction, income, and overtime hours by comparing data from 2018 (pre-pandemic) and 2022 (post-pandemic). By identifying key factors contributing to healthcare attrition, this research aims to provide actionable insights for improving retention and addressing burnout among healthcare workers. In this project, we are using 2022 Healthcare Employee Attrition1 dataset to find emerging trends after the pandemic to see the changes for nurses using national report data, we obtained from 2018 National Sample Survey of Registered Nurses Nursing Solutions Inc (NSI)2.

The first data source we will use in this project is Employee Attrition for Healthcare dataset from Kaggle, derived from 2022 NSI National Health Care Retention Report. This data shows survey data from the previous year, 2021, from 272 hospitals across 32 states. This survey covers 589,901 healthcare workers, and 166,087 Registered Nurses. We plan to use Python to transform the commas separated file to a pandas data frame to find valuable and relevant trends relating to the attrition rates for nurses.  
 
We also plan to scrape data from the 2018 National Sample Survey of Registered Nurses Nursing Solutions Inc, found in the National Library of Medicine. This contains the same metrics found in the other dataset and we will compare metrics to the previous years. In the report response data will be gathered from 43,937 Registered Nurses. 
 
Given the different time and lingering effects of COVID-19, we will compare nurse staffing data after covid to most recent reports. By looking at data from post pandemic, we will collect any trends or changes and figure out what factors might be influencing nurses to stay or leave. Using info from national healthcare surveys and data, we can find potential improvements the healthcare industry can make.
