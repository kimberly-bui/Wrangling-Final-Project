## Summary of the Analysis

### COVID-19's Impact on Healthcare Employment

This project delved into the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on healthcare employment, specifically focusing on nurse attrition. Key findings include:

* **Decreased Job Satisfaction:** A significant decline in job satisfaction among nurses post-pandemic, primarily due to increased workload, stress, and staffing shortages.
* **Increased Overtime:** A notable increase in overtime hours for nurses who left their jobs, suggesting a correlation between excessive workload and attrition.
* **Income and Attrition:** While income may play a role in attrition, it is not the sole factor. Other factors, such as work-life balance and job satisfaction, are equally important.
* **The Great Resignation:** The healthcare industry, like many others, experienced a period of high turnover rates, driven by factors such as burnout, low morale, and inadequate compensation.

To address these issues, healthcare institutions should prioritize employee well-being, implement effective workload management strategies, and offer fair compensation packages. Further research is necessary to identify specific causal factors and develop targeted interventions to improve nurse retention and overall healthcare worker satisfaction.
