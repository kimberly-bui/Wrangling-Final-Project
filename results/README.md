**Project: COVID-19's Impact on Healthcare Employment**

This project aims to analyze the effects COVID-19 had on employment in healthcare with job satisfaction, environment ratings, pay, and other ratings. We want to discover reasons for quitting and ways healthcare industries can improve. 

**Research Analysis:**

1. **Has job satisfaction for nurses changed since COVID?**

   According to our dataset, the percentage of dissatisfied nurses increased significantly from nearly 10% in 2018 to nearly 50% after COVID. This led to a higher number of nurses leaving their jobs.

2. **With high nurse turnover, has working overtime contributed to attrition rates?**

   The chart above shows that nurses who left their jobs in 2022 worked significantly more overtime compared to 2018. This suggests a correlation between increased overtime and higher attrition rates.

3. **The Great Resignation in Healthcare**

   The healthcare industry is facing a period known as the "Great Resignation," characterized by high turnover rates due to COVID-19. Factors contributing to this include:
   * Increased workload and stress
   * Emotional and physical toll on nurses
   * Persistent staffing shortages

4. **Does income factor into attrition?**

   Our analysis reveals significant income differences between nurses who left their jobs and those who stayed. This suggests that inadequate compensation may contribute to attrition, especially when combined with other factors like increased workload and stress.

5. **Is there a direct correlation between income and attrition?**

   A Pearson Correlation Coefficient test indicates a weak negative correlation between income and attrition. While income may play a role, it's not the sole factor influencing attrition.

6. **Which factors contribute to high attrition rates?**

   A linear regression model analysis suggests that higher income slightly reduces the likelihood of attrition, and younger nurses are more likely to leave. However, the model's high R-squared value indicates overfitting, limiting the reliability of these findings.

**Conclusion**

This study highlights the significant impact of COVID-19 on healthcare worker job satisfaction, income, and overtime hours, leading to increased attrition rates. Key findings include:

* A decline in job satisfaction due to increased workload, stress, and staffing shortages.
* A weak correlation between income and job satisfaction, suggesting other factors play a more significant role.
* Increased overtime hours in 2022 compared to 2018.

To improve employee retention, healthcare institutions should prioritize employee well-being, fair compensation, and effective workload management. Further research is needed to explore specific causal factors and develop targeted interventions.
